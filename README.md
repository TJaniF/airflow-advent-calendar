🎄 Airflow Advent Calendar 2025 ❄
=================================

Happy Holidays! What is the best part of the holiday season? Opening advend calendar windows of course! That 
is why I made an Airflow Advent Calendar. 🥰

How to open the windows
=======================

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. 
2. Make sure you have the [Astro CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/install-cli) installed and are at least on version 1.34.0. 
3. Run `astro dev start` to start the containers running Airflow. 
4. Open the Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080/.
5. Click on the DAGs view and you should 24 Dags, each for one day of the advent calendar. Run the Dag of today to open the window. You cannot open windows for future days.
6. Click on the **Browse** button and then on **Advent Calendar** to see the advent calendar plugin. Once a window has been opened you can click it to view your present for the day. 😊
